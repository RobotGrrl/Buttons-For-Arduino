[Buttons for Arduino](http://robotgrrl.com/apps4arduino/buttons.php)
==================

Interact with your Arduino in a quick, native and intuitive way using Buttons for Arduino! 

=== Features === 

  * Turn on and off your Arduino outputs with ease using the circle buttons 
  * Finely adjust the PWM outputs using the rotary sliders 
  * Customize button colours 
  * Full-screen mode (supported on 10.7+) 
  * No coding necessary 
  * API available

=== Works great for === 

  * Mood lighting - Have some LEDs connected to your Arduino for backlighting your computer desk, or similar? Easily control which LEDs are on and off to create a mixture of colours to suit your mood 

  * Quick testing - Experiment with different outputs and combinations for your project, without touching a single line of code 

  * Teaching students - Focus on the outputs and circuits without distractions. Demonstrate what happens when an output is on/off, and when the PWM changes from low to high 

  * Live demos - Effectively communicate your project's output ideas and concepts with others 

  * And more! - Arduino projects are only limited by your imagination! Create the next best project, and use Buttons for Arduino to control it 


To use Buttons for Arduino with your Arduino, install the ButtonsApp library from Buttons For Arduino's support website and upload the included example sketch to your Arduino. 

That's it! Sit back, relax, and press some buttons!


##Usage

To use this with your Arduino, download the [ButtonsApp](http://robotgrrl.com/apps4arduino/buttons/ButtonsApp.zip) library, and use the example sketch!

If you are going to be using Buttons for Arduino to build the application to use it as a standalone, then do a tweetware micro-action on [this page](http://robotgrrl.com/apps4arduino/buttons.php). :)
